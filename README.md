# Speed Estimation Using Ultralytics YOLOv8

## Overview

This repository contains code for estimating the speed of vehicles using Ultralytics YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to track vehicles in a video and estimate their speed based on their movement across predefined regions in the frame.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Google Colab (for running the code in a cloud environment)

## Installation
